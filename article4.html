      <article class="content">

        <p class="intro">
          Nowadays, fewer people go to the cinema compared to previous years. However, series have never been more influential.
          Whether positive or negative, the content we consume has a real impact on our behavior, our values, and the way we
          perceive society.
        </p>

        <h2>The rise of violence on screen</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most concerning issues is the growing presence of violence in films and series. A large part of today’s
          content revolves around crime, investigations, and brutality. In fact, nearly 70% of what audiences watch today
          consists of crime-related series.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being repeatedly exposed to violent scenes can significantly influence social behavior. Watching conflicts, murders,
          or illegal actions normalized on screen may reduce sensitivity and alter how violence is perceived in real life.
        </p>

        <h2>Identification with characters</h2>
        <p>
          Another powerful effect of cinema and series lies in identification. Many viewers seek to recognize themselves in
          fictional characters. Studies show that around 60% of people manage to identify with at least one character while
          watching a movie or a series.
        </p>

        <p>
          These characters often become sources of inspiration, shaping ambitions, attitudes, and sometimes even moral choices.
          This influence can be constructive — but also harmful if the values portrayed are distorted.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflecting society and its fears</h2>
        <p>
          Movies and series also manipulate our perception of society. Many of them reflect the darker aspects of the world we
          live in, projecting fears about technology, scientific progress, or changes in mentality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Films like <em>The Matrix</em> illustrate a future dominated by technology, questioning humanity’s place in an
          increasingly digital world. These narratives act as mirrors — and sometimes warnings — about where society might be
          heading.
        </p>

        <p class="endnote">
          Therefore, producers and creators should question the responsibility that comes with massive distribution.
          While violent content can influence negatively, cinema also has the power to inspire hope, resilience, and ambition.
          At its best, it reminds us that anyone can overcome obstacles and shape their future — and that imagination can help
          society evolve.
