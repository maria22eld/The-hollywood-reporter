        <p class="intro">
          We have all seen a movie where the girl on screen is pretty, with an angelic face, but only appears for ten minutes
          in a ninety-minute film. When this type of representation happens, I immediately ask myself: why do women so often have
          to look pretty — but not witty? Why “dumb but beautiful”?
        </p>

        <h2>1) The “helpless woman” cliché</h2>
        <p>
          First, I think some Hollywood directors do not like it when women take too much space on screen or stand up for themselves.
          In many films centered on a male protagonist, the female character is written mainly to admire him: brave, strong, fearless,
          reckless — the “always-knowing-what-to-do” type of man.
        </p>

        <p>
          Actress Reese Witherspoon raised awareness about this issue during Glamour’s 25th annual Women of the Year Awards at Carnegie Hall in 2015.
          She explained that in so many movies, she keeps hearing the same line from a woman in a crisis, with an innocent look:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          “What do we do now?”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          But in real life, have you ever seen a woman facing a serious situation with absolutely no idea what to do? This kind of false writing
          is exactly what makes female roles feel unrealistic — completely off the script.
        </p>

        <h2>2) Pregnancy, censorship, and body-shaming</h2>
        <p>
          Second, I believe there is a form of censorship around pregnancy and actresses returning to set after giving birth.
          Many actresses have received body-shaming comments during or after pregnancy. Yet having a baby is physically and mentally exhausting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Women do not need, on top of everything they are going through, comments about how their bodies changed or how they look “kind of tired”.
          Sometimes, when an actress comes back after pregnancy, the only role she is offered is the “fat funny girl”.
          The amount of body-shaming in the industry is deeply concerning.
        </p>

        <p class="endnote">
          In summary, female roles often fail to represent the complex — and sometimes difficult, but fulfilling — journey of being a woman.
          Next time you watch a movie, pay attention to the female character and ask yourself:
          <strong>Do I want my daughter to see herself in this character?</strong>
