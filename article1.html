        <p class="intro">
          We all saw, at least once in our life, a movie where the girl on screen was beautiful — an angel’s face —
          yet she only got ten minutes of screen time in a 90-minute film. When this happens, I always ask myself:
          why do women so often have to look <em>dumb but pretty</em> on screen? Why pretty, but not witty?
        </p>

        <h2> The “supporting woman” trope</h2>
        <p>
          First, I think some Hollywood directors really don’t like it when women take too much space or stand up for
          themselves. When a movie is centered around a male protagonist, the role given to the woman often becomes a
          simple tool: she is there to confirm how brave, strong, fearless and “always knowing what to do” the hero is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Actress Emily Blunt raised awareness about this during the Oscar nominees presentation in 2021. She said that
          in so many movies, during an emergency or crisis, there is always a woman looking innocent and asking:
        </p>

        <blockquote>“What do we do now?”</blockquote>

        <p>
          But have you ever seen, in a difficult real-life situation, a woman having absolutely no idea what to do?
          This is exactly the kind of false representation that makes female roles feel unrealistic and completely off script.
        </p>

        <h2> Pregnancy, censorship, and body standards</h2>
        <p>
          Second, I think there is a whole censorship around pregnancy and actresses getting back on set after giving birth.
          About 40% of Hollywood actresses have reportedly received mocking comments about their bodies during and after pregnancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let’s be clear: having a baby is a tough process — physically and mentally exhausting. Women don’t need, on top of
          everything they are going through, comments about how their bodies changed or how they look “kind of tired”.
          Sometimes, when an actress returns to filming after giving birth, the only role offered to her becomes the cliché of the
          “fat funny girl”. The amount of body shaming in the industry is genuinely concerning.
        </p>

        <p class="endnote">
          In summary, female roles still do not represent well enough the incredibly difficult — but fulfilling — journey that is
          being a woman. Next time you watch a movie, pay attention to the female character: how does she evolve throughout the film?
          And ask yourself: <strong>do I want my daughter to see herself in this character?</strong>
